# Hyperskill_2_Numeral_System_Converter
Convert number in the given base to another base.
About
We’re all quite used to our good old decimal system of numerals. But let’s not forget that there are countless other ways to count! Whether we convert numbers from one system to another just for fun or to store large data more efficiently, a converter would be helpful. In this project you will create a mathematical helper that will help you convert numbers from system M to system N.
Learning outcomes
Master loops and arrays, and learn how to handle errors. And besides, explore binary — one of the basic concepts in programming.

Input three lines:
  The source radix;
  The source number;
  The target radix.
Output contains the correct number representation in the given radix.
